0.3-0
    - introduced some arguments in the CoImp function used in the Hit or Miss and in the maximization of each marginal density function;
    - fixed a problem in the MCAR and MAR functions (missed a set.seed));
    - improved the argument plot of the CoImp function and the colnames in the two plots;
    - added some checks in all the functions;
    - updated references in the documentation;
    - changed the loglikCopula function call according to the changes in the copula package;
    - fixed a problem in the second while of the hitormiss function ('and' was substituted by 'or');
    - added a check on the presence of at least one complete record in the CoImp function;
    - added a check on the matrix in input of the functions MAR and MCAR.

0.2-3
    - cleaned and improved the documentation;
    - moved almost all the dependencies to the Imports section;
    - removed the dependence on tseriesEntropy package which is not on the CRAN.

0.2-2
    - removed the dependence on cubature package;
    - changed the function fcond.mod in CoImp_Esterne.R (the adaptIntegrate function of the cubature package is not used anymore
	and the check due to a bug in dcopula function have been deleted);
    - hitormiss function does not use anymore the vectorized version of the fcond function;
    - modified the computation of the median values of the data;
    - reintroduced methods plot and show;
    - introduced a function (MCAR) that generates missing completely at random;
    - introduced a function (MAR) that generates missing at random through a logistic multinomial regression model;
    - introduced a function (PerfMeasure) that computes a set of performance measures for a given imputed data set;
    - deleted the function for multiple imputation (CoImpEval).

0.2-1
    - added the cubature package in the Description file;
    - changed the function fcond.mod in CoImp_Esterne.R: now it uses the adaptIntegrate function of the cubature package;
    - example in CoImp.Rd: deleted three TRUE values in the call of the CoImp function (TRUE is default).

0.1-2
    - packaged under R 2.15.0;
    - deleted methods plot and show: problems should be fixed.

0.1-1
    - added a check to fcond.mod related to a bug in dcopula (package copula); to be removed;
    - fixed import warning on import(graphics).
